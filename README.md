# xerophyte-lang
An attempt to create an interpreted programming language. The first attempt tries to follow [tylerlaceby's](https://www.youtube.com/@tylerlaceby) tutorial on youtube.
The language will be implemented in TypeScript and it's REPL and Interpreter will run on [Deno](https://deno.com/runtime).
Later in the process I'll try to translate the learned knowledge to adjust and extend the language to create an esoteric programming language base on the german "I bims" youth speech.
